| [Detectig cell-types](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anyaprian/high-dimensional-data-projects/blob/main/projects/Gene-project.ipynb)  | The goal of the project is to define the number of clusters into which the cells in brain can be grouped. We need to test the hypothesis that there are three distinct types of cells in our brain: excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, and non-neuronal cells. The data is large, and to see it more clearly, three main dimesionality reduction techiques are applied: PCA, MDS and t-SNE. The clusterization methods tested: K-means and hierarchical clustering. Finally, to understand whether the differences between gene types are evident, we compared prediction accuracy on the top 100 features with the highest coefficients (from a logistic regression model) to features with the highest variances and to random features.  |
