| [Detectig cell-types](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anyaprian/high-dimensional-data-projects/blob/main/projects/Gene-project.ipynb) | It's a gene-project where the goal is to define the number of clusters which the cells in brain can be grouped at. We have to check the hypothesis that there are three distinct types of cells in our brain: excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, or non-neuronal cells. The data is large and to see it more clearly three main dimesionality reduction techiques are applied: PCA, MDS and t-SNE. The clusterization methods tested: K-means and hierarchical clustering. And finally, in order to understand if the differences between gene types are evident or not prediction accuracy on top 100 features with highest coeffs (of logistic regression model) were compared to features with highest variances and to random features. |
